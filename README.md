# 📱 Your Time Is Valuable. How Many Minutes Are You Losing?
While scrolling from one video to the next, you’re actually spending your most valuable asset — your time.
Short videos give your brain quick dopamine bursts, but the reward fades fast. Then you crave the next one.
Before you know it, hours pass, days slip away, and over the course of a year, a large portion of your life is gone.

🚨 Why It Matters
🎯 It steals your focus: Your attention span keeps getting shorter.
🛑 It kills your productivity: Empty consumption replaces productive time.
🪞 It shapes your life: What you spend your time on, you become.

💡 More Unconventional Solutions
📝 Produce while you consume: After each video, jot down 1 idea that comes to mind.
🔄 Reverse dopamine: Avoid checking your phone for the first hour after waking up — let your brain wake up naturally.
🎯 Micro-goals: Instead of saying “I’ll watch for 5 minutes,” say “I’ll watch 3 videos.”
❓ The ‘Why’ question: Before picking up your phone, ask “Why am I opening this?” If there’s no answer, don’t

💭 Remember: What you spend your time on ⏳ shapes your life 🌱.
Just 2 hours of daily Reels 📱 can waste about one month of your life every year 📆💨
